## Calculator
{:toc}  
AdvancedChat [ChatBox]() has the available option to use an in game calculator. It uses [mXparser](https://mathparser.org/) to do its business. (*Those who are more technically inclined should probably just explore the link.*)  

- For those needing a basic run down.  
	- mXparser is basically just a library of information that can be used by a programmer to create code that can dip its toes into the library for any information it may need.
	
In this case we are using it in Minecraft as a calculator. Simply put you can put into chat something simple like `1+2` or something as complex as `int( sqrt(1-x^2), x, -1, 1)`. Though for the average user what you need to know is that you don't need to worry about parentheses for longer equations.
