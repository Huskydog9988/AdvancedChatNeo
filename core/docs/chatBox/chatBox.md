## Settings Deep Dive  
{:toc}

As well as providing screen shots of their locations and more in-depth media in the Examples Sections located below.   
A note here quickly on the color values. ARGB and HEX+Alpha are the same, or rather very similar depending on who you ask. It's simply an 8 character string the comes after the pound sign(#) where the first two digits determine the alpha channel, aka the opacity of the color.

- Background Color - For this option when you change the value you are adjust the background color of the suggestion.
- Number of Suggestions - This simply changes what the maximum amount of suggestions to be shown at once.
