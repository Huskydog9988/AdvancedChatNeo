## Scripting

Scripting is super powerful for text manipulation. By default, these are disabled and extra precautions have been taken to try to provide as much safety. The scope that these filters can touch are relatively small and can only access a select few Java classes. Still, checking code before running is important.

To learn more about how to make them you can check out the `example_filters` directory and the wiki.
